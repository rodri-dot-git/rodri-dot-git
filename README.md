### About Me
Hey there! I’m Rodrigo, a Software Engineer currently working at [CBQA](https://www.cbqasolutions.com/). I’ve also done some freelancing projects on my own.

I love working on JS/TS projects that make a real difference. I’m all about doing things the right way from the start. I’m a QA specialist, and I speak Spanish and English.
